                <h3>Microsoft</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC
                interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with
                MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and
                subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among
                Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market
                and has made several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of Activision Blizzard
                for $68.7 billion in October 2023, followed by its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in
                December 2016, and its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.
