            <p>Peyush Bansal, a former Microsoft employee, founded Lenskart.com in 2010 along with Amit Chaudhary and
                Sumeet Kapahi. In 2011, early investor IDG Ventures India directed the company to also sell
                wristwatches, bags and jewellery online to replicate Titan Company's business. In 2011, the
                company launched Watchkart.com and Bagskart.com, and the following year, it started Jewelskart.com.[13]
                By the end of 2014, only Lenskart.com remained operative as the company shut down its other three
                websites to focus on the eyewear segment.</p>
