                <h3>Google</h3>

            </a>
            <p>Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while
                they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly
                listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company
                went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly
                owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for
                Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24,
                2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the
                CEO of Alphabet.</p>
